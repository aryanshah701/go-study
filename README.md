# GoStudy

A web-app to find and develop your curated list of study places!
See a community of like minded students develop around your favourite study place by effortlessly adding your space in just a few seconds, all made possible with our seemless integration with the Google Places API. Visit the app at [https://gostudy.aryanshah.tech](https://gostudy.aryanshah.tech).

## A note to the TAs

- A huge portion of this App's functionality depends on the use of the Geolocation API and hence you would need to grant the app access to your location to test most of our features.
- The google autocomplete feature(on the create a space page) is buggy on firefox and this seems to be a known issue with the Places API.
- Login/Registration takes a few seconds since a lot of data is being fetched.
- Our live comments feature only works with authenticated(signed in) users which is our way of incentivising Users to create accounts and contribute to our growing list of Study Spaces. Refreshing the page after logging in should connect you to the Phoenix channel for a given Space's page.
- Hope you enjoy!
