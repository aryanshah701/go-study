# GoStudy

A web-app to find study places near you!

## Setting Up Dev Environment

- Clone the project `git clone https://github.com/aryanshah701/go-study.git`

- Run `npm install` in the client directory and `mix deps.get` in the api directory

- Change the postgres user and password in dev.exs to your credentials

- Run `mix ecto.reset` to setup and seed the database

- Begin developing, and checkout the contributing section when you're ready to push your changes.

## Contributing

- **Please** do not commit any changes and push to main directly!

- Pull from main before you are ready to make any commits (`git checkout main` and then `git pull`).

- Create a new branch and checkout into it (`git checkout -b origin <new-branch>`).

- Commit your changes to the new branch.

- Push your **new branch** to github and submit a pull request (`git push -u <new-branch>`).

- I can merge your changes to main. Ping me if they need to be merged immidiately, or if I haven't done it in a few hours or so.
